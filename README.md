Dictionary generator.

The current computer program generates a vocabulary for an artificial language with a pre-developed grammar. 

The program receives a phonological set of the constructed language, complex of rules about syllable (the structure of syllables have and their components) as input. Then, based on the dictionaries of natural languages (English, Russian, etc.), the program generates sequences of symbols (or sounds) existing in this artificial language according to each lexeme in the dictionary of the natural language. 

In case there are some features connected with different noun or verb classes or any other way of dividing lexemes into groups, there is a possibility to divide lexemes randomly or to introduce some regularity.
